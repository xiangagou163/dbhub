## MCP Inspector

The [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) is a web-based debugging tool for testing and inspecting MCP servers. It's useful for:

- Testing DBHub server functionality before integrating with AI tools
- Debugging connection issues
- Exploring available resources and tools
- Verifying SQL query execution

Start DBHub with HTTP transport:

```bash
# Start DBHub with HTTP transport
npx @xiangagou/dbhub@latest --transport http --port 8080 --dsn "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb"

# Start the MCP Inspector in another terminal
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

The inspector will open in your browser where you can connect to `http://localhost:8080/mcp` and test all available tools and resources.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you can't connect to DBHub:

1. Verify DBHub is running with HTTP transport (`--transport http`)
2. Check the port matches (default: 8080)
3. Ensure no firewall is blocking the connection
4. Test the endpoint directly: `curl http://localhost:8080/mcp`

### Database Connection Errors

If DBHub connects but database queries fail:

1. Verify your DSN connection string is correct
2. Test the database connection with a native client
3. Check database user permissions
4. Review DBHub logs for specific error messages

### Logs

Enable verbose logging to troubleshoot issues:

```bash
# Set log level to debug
npx @xiangagou/dbhub@latest --transport http --port 8080 --dsn "your-dsn" --log-level debug
```
