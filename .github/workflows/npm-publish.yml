# Workflow for publishing the DBHub package to npm
# This workflow has two trigger modes:
#
# 1. Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch):
#    - Allows manually specifying version and tag
#    - Useful for deliberate releases
#
# 2. Automatic trigger (on push to main branch that modifies package.json):
#    - Detects if the version has changed
#    - Automatically determines the appropriate npm tag based on version format
#    - Skips publishing if the version already exists on npm
#
# Authentication: Uses OIDC trusted publishing (no npm tokens required)
# Prerequisites: Configure trusted publisher at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xiangagou/dbhub/access
#   - Organization/User: bytebase (or your npm org)
#   - Repository: dbhub
#   - Workflow filename: npm-publish.yml
#   - Environment: (leave empty unless using GitHub environments)
